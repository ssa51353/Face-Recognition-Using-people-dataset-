#Face Recognition Project with BERT :
-This project implements a face recognition system using a BERT-based architecture for text or related classification tasks. The notebook includes training, validation, and evaluation of the model with a custom pipeline.
#Project Features :
-Model Architecture: Utilizes a pre-trained BERT model for efficient feature extraction.
-Training Pipeline: Implements a PyTorch-based training loop with automatic validation.
-Evaluation: Measures performance using loss and accuracy metrics on the validation dataset.
-Model Saving: Automatically saves the best model based on validation loss.
#The requirements can be looked upon aas follows :
scikit-learn>=1.0.0
numpy>=1.21.0
matplotlib>=3.4.3
pandas>=1.3.3
#Explanation of the Libraries:
-scikit-learn:
#For classification_report, GridSearchCV, train_test_split, SVC, PCA, make_pipeline, and fetch_lfw_people.
-numpy:
#Required for numerical computations and matrix manipulations used internally in scikit-learn.
-matplotlib:
#Useful if you intend to visualize results or data.
-pandas:
Often used for handling datasets and preprocessing; included for potential dataset handling.
